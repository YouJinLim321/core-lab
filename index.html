	<blockquote>"How I archive my digital photos and memos"</blockquote>

 <p> My most important files are my diary. I tend to write down my secrets that I keep in my diary. Writing down things on ipad is really interesting. I love the way how I write my secrets down with apple pencil. Apple pencil allows me to write things softly. Also, I enjoy the process of documenting my personal story. This is because I can recall my emotions and sometimes adjust my feelings that goes up and down like a roller coaster. My actual dream is to collect my diaries and publishing a book. It would be great to share my point of view to the people in the world. I guess the process would be really exciting and also worthy. I also want to add some of my artworks in my publication. It would be a great resource for people who wants to listen to my story, or who had a similar experience with me. </p>
